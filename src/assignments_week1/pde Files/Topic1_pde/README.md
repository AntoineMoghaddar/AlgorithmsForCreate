#Algorithms for Creative Technology

##Initial Disclaimers
- This project is created inside of a Java Project. 
  As the processing language is built upon Java, I have decided to use the Processing-Core.jar as a library within this project. 
  This does mean that the Processing IDE does not always support some actions. Within the Intelij IDE the entire code should run correctly*
- This code is written for the Algorithms for Create course given on the university of Twente
- There is a small buig in the menu, causing you to ask you for input twice
- For all assignments, the pde files have been included, these files have been used for uploading to atelier
- The original project with all the running code can be found on the Git Repository: [Algorithms For Create Repo](https://github.com/AntoineMoghaddar/AlgorithmsForCreate), Please use this repo/code to test the functionality.

*The code runs correctly for assignment 1 - 10; This is not the case for assignment 1.11, which should specifically be run in the processing IDE.
